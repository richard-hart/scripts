#The results of the above command displays the objectID, name and description of each role.  
#You will notice from the display of roles that “Global Admins” is not present.  
#However, “Global Admins” is represented by “Company Administrator” via PowerShell

#NOTE: The ObjectID for “Company Administrator” is unique to every Office 365 tenant.

#Enter the following command with your ObjectID to get a list of users assigned as global admins:

Get-MsolRoleMember -RoleObjectId "ObjectID"


#The results will provide a comprehensive list of those that have access to make changes to and administer your Office 365 tenant, and this list of users will also receive email notifications #from the Microsoft Office 365 Team.  

#Check often and make modifications or corrections as needed to maintain the security of your tenant.
