Creating a PowerShell Profile

The first thing we need to do is check if you already have a profile:

Test-Path $Profile

As you can see we don’t have a profile file yet, so we will need to create one, you can easily do that with the New-Item cmdlet:

New-Item –Path $Profile –Type File –Force

Note: Using the force parameter will cause a profile to be created even if you already had one. This means your old profile will be overwritten.


You can edit your profile using notepad, which is easily started using PowerShell:

notepad $Profile
