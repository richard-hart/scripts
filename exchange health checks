Diagnostics & health checks


First, get a server health summary:
Get-HealthReport -identity <ServerName>


If any HealthSet returns unhealthy, perform the following:

Get-ServerHealth –Identity <ServerName> –HealthSet <HealthSetName>

This results in a verbose report showing which monitors are unhealthy:

Get-ServerHealth –Identity <ServerName> –HealthSet MailboxTransport
Invoke-MonitoringProbe ActiveSync.Protocol\ActiveSyncDeepTestProbe -Server <ServerName> | Format-List

I then recycled the ActiveSync application pool (MSExchangeSyncAppPool) in IIS Manager and I also restarted the Health Manager service

To quickly check the state of Mailbox Server Role, CAS Role, UM Server Role and Hub Transport Server Role, type the following:

Test-ServiceHealth -identity <ServerName>
To test Edge Sync:
Test-EdgeSynchronization

To test mail flow:
Test-Mailflow
